## Installation
### Requirements

* [node.js]
* [mongodb]
* [redis]

### Steps for you local (development) copy
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:zkiiito/SURF.git surf
$ cd surf
$ export TESTMODE=1
$ npm ci
$ node Surf.js
```
After this, your server is running on http://localhost:8000/ with google authtentication, http://localhost:8000/loginTest with no authentication, and http://localhost:8000/admin for administration (default login with admin/adminPass).

If you need facebook auth, edit the config file /code/Config.js with your facebook appId and appSecret, and http://localhost:8000/auth/facebook will be your friend.

## Development

You want to develop? Cool!

##### Minify client-side js every time it changes:
* setup your IDE to run "npm run build" every time files change in the client/js or admin/js folder, excluding surf.min.js and admin.min.js
* the pre-commit package will take care of uglifying when committing

##### Test
start the server and
```
$ npm test
```
should do the rest!
